Cisco SD-WAN is a software-defined way to connect branch offices, data centers, and cloud environments over any type of network connection (MPLS, broadband Internet, LTE/5G), while keeping centralized control, security, and performance guarantees.

      Cisco SD-WAN is a centrally controlled, policy-driven WAN that securely uses any transport and automatically chooses the best path for each application.

Instead of manually configuring routers site-by-site, you define intent once, and the network enforces it everywhere.

The Core Problem SD-WAN Solves
Traditional WANs:
    Are hardware-centric
    Depend heavily on expensive MPLS
    Require manual configuration per router
    Are slow to adapt to cloud apps (SaaS, IaaS)

Cisco SD-WAN fixes this by:
    Separating control from data forwarding
    Using software policies
    Dynamically choosing the best path per application

Cisco SD-WAN at a High Level
1. Overlay vs Underlay
    Underlay = The physical network
    (Internet, MPLS, LTE, 5G — whatever you have)
    Overlay = Secure tunnels (IPsec) built on top of the underlay

SD-WAN doesn’t replace the network — it abstracts and optimizes it.

Key Cisco SD-WAN Components

    1) vManage – Management Plane
        Single web dashboard
        Configurations, monitoring, troubleshooting
        Zero-Touch Provisioning (ZTP)
    
    2) vSmart – Control Plane
        Centralized routing intelligence
        Distributes policies (QoS, routing, security)
        Decides how traffic should flow
    
    3) vBond – Orchestration Plane
        First point of contact for new devices
        Handles authentication and NAT traversal
    
    4) Edge Routers (cEdge / vEdge) – Data Plane
        Sit at branches, DCs, cloud
        Forward actual traffic
        Measure link performance in real time

How Traffic Decisions Are Made
Cisco SD-WAN continuously measures:
    Latency
    Jitter
    Packet loss

Policies can say things like:
    “Voice must stay under 150ms latency”
    “ERP traffic prefers MPLS”
    “If loss > 2%, fail over immediately”

The router then dynamically chooses the best path per packet.

Why Enterprises Use Cisco SD-WAN

    1) Operational Benefits
        Centralized management
        Faster branch deployment (minutes, not weeks)
        Reduced human error
    
    2) Cost Benefits
        Use cheaper Internet links
        Reduce MPLS dependency
        Better bandwidth utilization
    
    3) Application Performance
        App-aware routing
        SaaS optimization
        Cloud-first design
    
    4) Security Integration
        Encrypted tunnels by default
        Segmentation (VRFs)
        Integrates with firewall, Zscaler, Umbrella, SASE


Simple Mental Model (For Exams & Interviews)
    vManage = “The dashboard”
    vSmart = “The brain”
    vBond = “The door guard”
    Edge routers = “The workers moving traffic”
