cool.  I would like the basic configuration for Cisco 8201-24H8FH router. Please omit all Fiber interfaces at this point, I only want to focus on RJ-45 connections and ports 


That was good.  Let's implement a few values.
Router BGP with ASN 65501 network 169.254.90.12/30  This needs network interface IP 169.254.90.13/32

Router OSPF Area 1 Network 10.30.0.0/16 this needs network interface IP10.30.0.1/16

Router EIGRP AS 20 network 192.168.20.0/24 this needs network interface IP 192.168.20.1/24

BGP routes need to be redistributed into OSPF Area 1.  OSPF does not advertise routes to BGP.  

EIGRP routes need to be redistributed into OSPF Area 1. EIGRP does not advertise routes into EIGRP




 okay so the BGP interface is running IPSec and it's neighbor is 169.254.90.14/32. Can you please provide a configuration for this and include/generate:

Pre-shared keys.
IKE v2 
timeout: Default
AH 14
Sha-256
Use normal default values for the rest. 



Okay so I would to deploy this initial config to the Cisco router using Ansible. Can you generate a generic playbook for this purpose?
